    "**Research Question 1**   \n",
    "Does the perceived capability of friends' ability for social support (PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_friends_subscale_score) differ between individuals with low versus high levels of self-esteem (PSYCH_self_esteem_unknown_scale_high)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables to Explore:*   \n",
    "    PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_friends_subscale_score (Numeric, from 1 to 7): perceived friends' capability to provide social support. 1 indicates not capable at all, and 7 indicates perfectly capable.   \n",
    "    PSYCH_self_esteem_unknown_scale_high: (Categorical: (1) Not very true of me; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; (7) Very true of me): perceived self-esteem. (1) Not very true of me indicates low self-esteem and (7) Very true of me indicates high self-esteem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planned Exploration:*   \n",
    "    Calculate the means and standard deviations of the perceived capability of friends' ability for social support (PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_friends_subscale_score) for each level of self-esteem (PSYCH_self_esteem_unknown_scale_high).   \n",
    "    Visualize the distribution of perceived support scores across different self-esteem categories using boxplots or histograms.   \n",
    "    Categorize Self-Esteem based on the self-esteem scale (1 to 7). Low self-esteem: Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4; high self-esteem: categories 5, 6, and 7.   \n",
    "    Check the normality of the perceived support scores for each self-esteem group (low vs high). If the data are normally distributed, use parametric tests. If not, consider non-parametric alternatives.   \n",
    "\n",
    "*Planned Analysis:*   \n",
    "    Independent Samples t-test (Parametric Approach): if the data for each group (low self-esteem vs high self-esteem) are normally distributed, perform an independent samples t-test to compare the means of perceived social support between the two groups.   \n",
    "    If the data are not normally distributed, perform the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the medians of perceived social support between the low and high self-esteem groups.   \n",
    "    Create side-by-side boxplots comparing perceived support for individuals with low versus high self-esteem. This is done because boxplots clearly visualize the quartiles, distribution, and the mean for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hypothesis:*   \n",
    "    Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in the perceived capability of friends' ability for social support between individuals with low self-esteem and those with high self-esteem.   \n",
    "    Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): There is a significant difference in the perceived capability of friends' ability for social support between individuals with low self-esteem and those with high self-esteem.   \n",
    "    Expected Result: If individuals with higher self-esteem perceive their friends as more capable of providing social support, we would expect the mean (or median) of perceived support to be significantly higher in the high self-esteem group compared to the low self-esteem group. On the other hand, if self-esteem has no effect on perceived social support, we would expect to find no significant difference between the two groups.   \n",

    "**Research Question 2**   \n",
    "Is there evidence that individuals with more time spent on social media (CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day) feel more anxious (WELLNESS_gad_anxious)?\n",

    "*Variables to Explore:* \n",
    "    CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day (Categorical: Less than 10 minutes per day; 10-30 minutes per day; 31-60 minutes per day; 1-2 hours per day; 2-3 hours per day; More than 3 hours per day): Daily hours spent on social media.   \n",
    "    WELLNESS_gad_anxious (Categorical: Not at all; Several days; More than half the days; Nearly every day): how often over the past two weeks felt anxious.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planned Exploration:*   \n",
    "    Descriptive statistics to summarize the distribution of the variables: frequency counts and percentages for both CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day and WELLNESS_gad_anxious.   \n",
    "    Using stacked bar charts to visualize and understand how anxiety levels (WELLNESS_gad_anxious) vary with time spent on social media (CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day). This is done because it gives a straightforward representation of the approximate ratio of people that fall into each group of anxiety.   \n",
    "    Look for any potential patterns or trends in how social media usage relates to anxiety.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planned Analysis:* conduct a Chi-Squared Test of Independence.   \n",
    "    To assess whether there is a significant association between the categorical variables CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day and WELLNESS_gad_anxious.   \n",
    "    The test will examine if the distribution of anxiety levels differs across the different time categories of social media use.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hypothesis:*\n",
    "    Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant association between the amount of time spent on social media and the frequency of anxiety experienced.   \n",
    "    Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): There is a significant association between the amount of time spent on social media and the frequency of anxiety experienced.   \n",
    "    Expected Result: Individuals who spend more time on social media are more likely to report higher anxiety levels.\n",

    "**Research Question 3**   \n",
    "Do younger individuals (DEMO_age) spend more time on social media (CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables to Explore:*   \n",
    "    DEMO_age (Numeric): Age of individuals.   \n",
    "    CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day (Categorical: Less than 10 minutes per day; 10-30 minutes per day; 31-60 minutes per day; 1-2 hours per day; 2-3 hours per day; More than 3 hours per day): Daily hours spent on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planned Exploration:*   \n",
    "    Calculate the mean, median, and range of age for each category of social media time. This will help to understand the central tendency of age within different social media usage groups.\n",
    "    A suitable visualization would be a boxplot, which shows the distribution of age within each category of social media time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planned Analysis:*   \n",
    "    Compute the correlation between the numeric age variable and the categorical variable by converting it into an ordinal scale to understand the strength of the relationship (that is, define \"Less than 10 minutes per day\" as 1, \"10-30 minutes per day\" as 2, \"31-60 minutes per day\" as 3, \"1-2 hours per day\" as 4, \"2-3 hours per day\" as 5, and \"More than 3 hours per day\" as 6). Then, calculate the average for each group of social media time and visualize the data using a boxplot.\n",
    "    Then, use Spearman's Rank Correlation to calculate the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A number from 0 to 1 means that age goes up along with social media time, with 1 being perfect positive correlation. In this case, we aim for a negative number from 0 to -1, with -1 being perfect negative correlation (ideally, we aim for -0.05 and below).   \n",
    "    Then, do a one-way ANOVA Test (Analysis of Variance) to compare age across different social media categories. This test is used to determine if at least one group mean is statistically different from the others. We use one-way because we only have one independent variable, differing from two-way ANOVA which is used when there are two independent variables. The larger the value, the more statistically different the values are from other groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hypothesis:*   \n",
    "    Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between age and time spent on social media.   \n",
    "    Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): Younger individuals spend more time on social media than older individuals.   \n",
    "    Expected Result: Younger individuals will likely spend more time on social media compared to older individuals. This could manifest as a smaller mean number in the higher social media usage categories, and a potential decrease in time spent on social media as age increases."
